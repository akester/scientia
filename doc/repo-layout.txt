Scientia - Free Knowledge

I'm writing this now because I know I'll get questions about the repo layout.

The point is to try and avoid the Linux Kernel's (sorry Linus) problem of being
so large.  I know git can work wonders in large settings, but to try and
maintain loads of files in one repo sounds ... tortouruous.

Instead, I've designed the repo to take advantage of git's submodule feature.
What this will do is allow a team to maintain thier own repo with thier own
branching and the like.  When they are ready to merge changes into the larger
picture, they contact the repo manager and request that the branch be brought
into the main program.

This allows for a few things:
	-Teams can be formed for speific areas of development, and have access to
	only thier area.
	-Users can clone only certain areas of the project (if they wish).
	-Users have more power over versioning.  They can choose to run some
	stable and some bleeding edge.
	
If you have a better way to do things, I'm always ears.
