Scientia - Free Knowledge

CLONING THE PROJECT

	I made the project Open Souce so ANYONE could modify the source and help
improve Scientia.  I use a non-standard approach to the repositories, mainly
to aide in deployment as well as ensuring a user gets all of the needed
sub-projects.

To Clone:
	1- Clone the main git project at:
			http://git.aikester.com/scientia/scientia.git
	2- Navigate to the 'scripts' directory and execute:
			./init-submodules.sh
		This will download all of the needed submodules at the stable commit.
		If you want bleeding edge new, run the script:
			./update-submodules.sh
		This will pull the LATEST code for ALL of the submodules. (Hint: You
		might just want to do this to one submodule)
		
Happy Coding.
